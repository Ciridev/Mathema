# Mathema
Mathema is a Multi-purpose equation solver and graphic calculator I'm developing. It supports many others features such as conversions, functional calculus and more. Check the Roadmap section for more information on planned features.

# Roadmap 
This is the Planned roadmap:

### Arithmetic Solver
* Natural expressions 
* Rational expressions
* Real expressions 

### Algebraic Solver
* Monomial and Polynomial expressions
* Exponentials and Logarithmic expressions
* Goniometric expressions
* Complex epressions 

### Calculus 
* Limits
* Derivatives (Hopefully partial derivatives and n-order derivatives)
* Integrals 
* Taylor Series 
* Newton's Iterative Method

### Linear Algebra
* Matrix operations
* Vector operations 

### Equations and Inequalities
* Linear Equations and Inequalities
* Quadratic Equations and Inequalities
* Cubic Equations and Inequalities
* Quarti Equations and Inequalities [?] (A little bit overkill maybe)
* Systems of Equations
